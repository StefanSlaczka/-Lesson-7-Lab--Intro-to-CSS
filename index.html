      I am a Web Development Student. I love spending time with friends and
      faminly. I love learning new things in tech. Here is what I learned in Wake Tech Commuity College. Group Projects 
      •	Agile College Registration System (Python): Developed a command line terminal application for college registration using Python as part of an agile project.
      •	SQL Database (SQL): Created a SQL database using a provided template, focusing on a library-based system.
      •	Airline Boarding App (Python): Collaborated with teammates to create an airline boarding app in Python, implementing advanced features using classes and objects. Optimized the app's performance by using libraries like map() and reduce(), and designed a GUI for testing.
      •	Library App (SQL): Utilized software engineering principles to create a library app that interacts with a LAN network and serves as the UI. The project involved the use of SQL databases.
      •	Selenium Testing (Selenium): Learned Selenium for website testing during a group lab and created instructional materials for new learners, covering Behavior-Driven Development, API testing, Test-Driven Development, and DevOps and CI/CD.
